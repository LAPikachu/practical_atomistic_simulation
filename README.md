# practical_atomistic_simulation
Practical exercises for atomistic simulation utilizing ASE

for setting up the environment use:    
`pip install -r requirementts.txtÂ´    

if conda is used:
to set up the environment use conda - start with  
`conda env create --name atomistic --file=environment.yml`  
`conda activate atomistic`

if work has been done adding new packages, etc. changing the environment use  
`conda env export > environment.yml`  
to update .yml

the python files are associated with different Tasks in the Problem Statement  
minimize_energy.py -> Task 3.2
elastic_constants.py -> Task 3.5
